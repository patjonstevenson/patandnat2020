      <h2>The Ceremony</h2>
      <p>
        We will be getting married in a Traditional Latin Mass. For those who
        have never attended a Catholic Mass, or are unfamiliar with the
        Traditional Latin Mass, we have included some information about what to
        expect and how to behave. Please wear appropriate clothing. This means
        no spaghetti straps or plunging necklines for women. We want to respect
        the presence of God in this chapel. Most of the Mass does not require
        participation from the congregation. At the Mass, we will have booklets
        that will aid you in following the ceremony, since most of it will be in
        Latin. The vows, readings, and homily will be in English, so if you
        would prefer you may simply sit and observe. Information Non Catholics
