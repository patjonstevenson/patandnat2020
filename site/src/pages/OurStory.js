      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>We are both from Simi Valley, California, but we first met at the Easter Vigil Mass at St. Rose in Simi Valley in April 2019, when Patrick was received into the Catholic Church.  One month later Patrick’s godfather set us up at his wedding reception, held in the Gomez backyard.  We talked to each other until after the reception was over and all the other guests had left, and then we saw each other every day for the next ten days.  We decided to date at the beginning of June, just before Madeline flew back to the University of Notre Dame for summer classes.  Patrick visited Notre Dame that summer, and we began a routine of flying between California and Indiana to visit each other as Madeline entered the second year of her master’s program and Patrick began an online computer programming bootcamp.  Patrick proposed just before Christmas at Grant Park in Ventura, under the cross overlooking the ocean and farmlands and city.</p>
